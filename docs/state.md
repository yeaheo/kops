# The State Store

kops has the notion of a 'state store'; a location where we store the configuration of your cluster.  State is stored
here not only when you first create a cluster, but also you can change the state and apply changes to a running cluster.

Eventually, kubernetes services will also pull from the state store, so that we don't need to marshal all our
configuration through a channel like user-data.  (This is currently done for secrets and SSL keys, for example,
though we have to copy the data from the state store to a file where components like kubelet can read them).

The state store uses kops's VFS implementation, so can in theory be stored anywhere.
As of now the following state stores are supported:

* Amazon AWS S3 (s3://)
* local filesystem (file://)
* Digital Ocean (do://)
* MemFS (memfs://)
* Google Cloud (gs://)
* Kubernetes (k8s://)
* OpenStack Swift (swift://)
* AliCloud (oss://)

The state store is just files; you can copy the files down and put them into git (or your preferred version control system).

## {statestore}/config

One of the most important files in the state store is the top-level config file.  This file stores the main
configuration for your cluster (instance types, zones, etc)\

When you run `kops create cluster`, we create a state store entry for you based on the command line options you specify.
For example, when you run with `--node-size=m4.large`, we actually set a line in the configuration
that looks like `NodeMachineType: m4.large`.

The configuration you specify on the command line is actually just a convenient short-cut to
manually editing the configuration.  Options you specify on the command line are merged into the existing
configuration. If you want to configure advanced options, or prefer a text-based configuration, you
may prefer to just edit the config file with `kops edit cluster`.

Because the configuration is merged, this is how you can just specify the changed arguments when
reconfiguring your cluster - for example just `kops create cluster` after a dry-run.

## State store configuration

There are a few ways to configure your state store.  In priority order:

+ command line argument `--state s3://yourstatestore`
+ environment variable `export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://yourstatestore`
+ config file `$HOME/.kops.yaml`
+ config file `$HOME/.kops/config`

### Configuration file example:

`$HOME/.kops/config` might look like this:

```
kops_state_store: s3://yourstatestore
```

## State store variants

### S3 state store

The state store for S3 can be either configured via AWS env variables or directly with custom S3 credentials via env variables. The default for the s3 store is using AWS credentials.

It is possible to set the ACLs for the bucket by setting the env variable `KOPS_STATE_S3_ACL`.

#### AWS S3 config

Normally configured via AWS environment variables or AWS credentials file. The mechanism used to retrieve the credentials is derived from the AWS SDK as follows:

``` golang
config = aws.NewConfig().WithRegion(region)
config = config.WithCredentialsChainVerboseErrors(true)
```

where region is fetched from `AWS_REGION` or from ec2 metadata if we're running within EC2. It defaults to `us-east-1`.

#### Custom s3 compatible store

Your custom s3 state store can be configured by providing S3 environment variables:

- `S3_ENDPOINT`: your custom endpoint
- `S3_REGION`: the region to use
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: your access key
- `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: your secret key

#### Moving state between S3 buckets

The state store can easily be moved to a different s3 bucket. The steps for a single cluster are as follows:

1. Recursively copy all files from `${OLD_KOPS_STATE_STORE}/${CLUSTER_NAME}` to `${NEW_KOPS_STATE_STORE}/${CLUSTER_NAME}` with `aws s3 sync` or a similar tool.
2. Update the `KOPS_STATE_STORE` environment variable to use the new S3 bucket.
3. Either run `kops edit cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}` or edit the cluster manifest yaml file. Update `.spec.configBase` to reference the new s3 bucket.
4. Run `kops update cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} --yes` to apply the changes to the cluster. Newly launched nodes will now retrieve their dependent files from the new S3 bucket. The files in the old bucket are now safe to be deleted.

Repeat for each cluster needing to be moved.

#### Cross Account State-store (AWS S3)

There are situations in which the entity executing kops to create the cluster is not in the same account as the owner of the state store bucket. In this case, you must explicitly grant the permission: `s3:getBucketLocation` to the ARN that is running kops.

You can use the following policy to guide your implementation:

```
{
    "Id": "123",
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "123",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::state-store-bucket",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::123456789:user/kopsuser"
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Digital Ocean (do://)

DigitalOcean storage is configured as a flavor of a S3 store.

## AliCloud (oss://)

The alicloud oss store can be configured by the following environment variables:

- `OSS_REGION`: the region to use
- `ALIYUN_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: your access key
- `ALIYUN_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`: your secret key
- `ALIYUN_OSS_INTERNAL`: whether the OSS store is internally

## OpenStack Swift (swift://)

The swift store can be configured by providing your OpenStack credentials and configuration in environment variables:

- `OS_AUTH_URL`: the identity endpoint to authenticate against
- `OS_USERNAME`: the username to use
- `OS_USERID`: the user ID
- `OS_PASSWORD`: the password for the useraccount
- `OS_TENANT_ID`: the tenant id
- `OS_TENANT_NAME`: the tenant name
- `OS_PROJECT_ID`: the poject id
- `OS_PROJECT_NAME`: the project name
- `OS_DOMAIN_ID`: the domain ID
- `OS_DOMAIN_NAME`: the domain name
- `OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_ID`: application credential ID
- `OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_NAME`: application credential name
- `OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_SECRET`: application secret

The mechanism used to retrieve the credentials is derived from the [gophercloud OpenStack SDK](https://godoc.org/github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud).

A credentials file with `OPENSTACK_CREDENTIAL_FILE` or a config derived from your personal credentials living in `$HOME/.openstack/config` can also be used to configure your store.

## Google Cloud (gs://)

The state store config for google cloud will be derived by the google storage client SDK as follows:

``` golang
scope := storage.DevstorageReadWriteScope

httpClient, err := google.DefaultClient(context.Background(), scope)
if err != nil {
	return nil, fmt.Errorf("error building GCS HTTP client: %v", err)
}

gcsClient, err := storage.New(httpClient)

```
