## Release notes for kops 1.12 series

# Significant changes

* kops 1.12 enables etcd-manager by default.  For kubernetes 1.12 (and later) we
  default to etcd3.  We also enable TLS for etcd communications when using
  etcd-manager.  More information is in the [etcd migration
  documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/etcd3-migration.md)
* Components are no longer allowed to interact with etcd directly.  Calico will
  be switched to use CRDs instead of directly with etcd.  This is a disruptive
  upgrade, please read the calico notes in the [etcd migration
  documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/etcd3-migration.md)

# Required Actions

* Please back-up important data before upgrading, as the [etcd2 to etcd3
  migration](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/etcd3-migration.md)
  is higher risk than most upgrades.
* Note that the upgrade for Calico users is disruptive, because it requires
  switching from direct-etcd-storage to CRD backed storage.

# Full change list since 1.11.0 release
